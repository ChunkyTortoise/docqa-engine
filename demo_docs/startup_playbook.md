# Startup Playbook

## Finding Product-Market Fit

Product-market fit is the point where your product satisfies a strong market demand. The clearest signal is organic growth: users recommend the product without being asked, retention rates are high, and demand outpaces your ability to supply. Before reaching this stage, most teams iterate rapidly through customer interviews, prototypes, and feedback cycles.

Start by identifying a specific problem that a defined group of people experiences frequently and painfully. Talk to at least 30 potential customers before building anything. Look for patterns in their workarounds, frustrations, and willingness to pay. If people are cobbling together spreadsheets, manual processes, or multiple tools to solve the problem, there is likely a product opportunity.

## MVP Development

A minimum viable product strips away every feature that is not essential to testing your core hypothesis. The goal is learning speed, not feature completeness. Build the smallest thing that lets you validate whether your solution addresses the target problem.

Timebox your MVP to four to six weeks. If it takes longer, scope is too broad. Common MVP formats include landing pages with signup forms, concierge services where you manually deliver the value, Wizard of Oz prototypes with a human behind the interface, and single-feature applications. Measure engagement rather than opinions. What people do matters more than what they say they will do.

## Fundraising Basics

Fundraising follows a predictable pattern. Pre-seed rounds typically range from 250,000 to one million dollars from angel investors and micro-VCs. Seed rounds range from one to four million dollars and fund the path to product-market fit. Series A rounds start at five million dollars and fund scaling a proven model.

Investors evaluate four dimensions: team capability, market size, traction, and differentiation. Your pitch deck should cover the problem, solution, market opportunity, business model, traction to date, team background, and the specific ask. Practice the pitch until you can deliver it in under four minutes. Follow up within 24 hours of every meeting.

## Team Building

Early hires define company culture more than any values statement. Prioritize people who are self-directed, comfortable with ambiguity, and motivated by the mission. The first ten employees set the operating norms that persist for years.

Cofounders should have complementary skills and aligned values. The most common cofounder conflicts involve equity splits, role definitions, and commitment levels. Address these explicitly in a founders agreement before writing a single line of code. Vest equity over four years with a one-year cliff to protect all parties.

## Metrics That Matter

Focus on a small set of metrics that directly reflect business health. For SaaS products, the core metrics are monthly recurring revenue, customer acquisition cost, lifetime value, churn rate, and net revenue retention. For marketplaces, track gross merchandise value, take rate, and liquidity.

Vanity metrics like total signups, page views, and social media followers feel good but do not indicate sustainable growth. Actionable metrics connect directly to business decisions. If a metric does not change what you build or how you sell, stop tracking it.

## Pivoting Strategy

A pivot is a structured course correction based on evidence, not a panic reaction. The decision to pivot should follow clear criteria: engagement metrics are flat after meaningful iteration, customer feedback consistently points to a different problem, or the unit economics do not support the current model.

Common pivot types include customer segment pivots (same product, different audience), problem pivots (same audience, different problem), channel pivots (different distribution strategy), and technology pivots (different implementation of the same solution). Preserve what is working and change what is not. The best pivots leverage existing assets, customer relationships, and domain knowledge rather than starting from scratch.
